# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Kotlin Multiplatform / Compose Multiplatform project targeting **Android** and **iOS** (arm64 device + arm64 simulator). Application id / namespace: `com.anthooop.colision`. Single Gradle module: `:composeApp`.

Toolchain: Kotlin 2.3.21, AGP 8.11.2, Compose Multiplatform 1.10.3, Material3 1.10.0-alpha05, JVM target 11, Android `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 36, `minSdk` 28. Versions are centralized in `gradle/libs.versions.toml` (version catalog) — change versions there, not in module build files. `settings.gradle.kts` enables `TYPESAFE_PROJECT_ACCESSORS`.

## Product context

Colision is a scheduling app that detects cross-commission meeting conflicts. Primary persona (Sophie) has **near-zero tech literacy** — the UX bar is "simpler than WhatsApp".

When implementing, optimize for: minimal taps, no jargon, generous touch targets, immediate feedback. Reject any flow that would confuse a non-technical user, even if it's "the Android way".

## Source-of-truth documentation — read before implementing

**Every feature, sub-screen, or non-trivial change must be grounded in these documents.** Read them in this order before writing code or proposing an approach:

1. **`docs/product-brief-Colision-2026-05-10.md`** — product vision, persona (Sophie), problem framing. Read once per session to anchor decisions.
2. **`docs/prd.md`** — current PRD: scope, requirements, user journeys (J1–J4), acceptance criteria, edge cases. **Authoritative source for what the feature should do.** If the request contradicts the PRD, flag it before implementing.
3. **User stories / epics** — currently embedded in `docs/prd.md`. When BMAD splits stories into separate files (under `docs/` per BMAD output convention), read the relevant story file end-to-end before touching code.
4. **`docs/architecture.md`** — current architectural decisions and constraints. Anything you build must comply with the patterns documented there; if you need to deviate, surface it explicitly.
5. **`docs/design/`** — visual + interaction contract. Specifically:
   - `docs/design/chats/chat1.md` — design intent and rationale (read once per session).
   - `docs/design/project/tokens.jsx` — colors, typography, spacing.
   - `docs/design/project/components.jsx` — shared components.
   - `docs/design/project/screens-<feature>.jsx` — the screens of the feature you're working on.

If any of these documents are missing context the task needs (a sub-screen not in the design, an unclear acceptance criterion, conflicting copy between PRD and design), **stop and ask the user** rather than guessing. The cost of one clarifying question is far less than building the wrong thing.

When you write or update a feature, the resulting code must be traceable back to: a PRD requirement / story (the *what* and *why*), the architecture doc (the *how it fits*), and the design (the *how it looks and behaves*). If you can't point to all three, you're missing context.

## Common commands

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleDevelopmentDebug    # Android debug APK (development flavor)
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleProductionDebug     # Android debug APK (production flavor)
./gradlew :composeApp:installDevelopmentDebug     # Install dev flavor on device
./gradlew :composeApp:check                       # Lint + tests for all targets
./gradlew :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest           # Android unit tests
./gradlew :composeApp:iosSimulatorArm64Test       # commonTest on iOS simulator
./gradlew :composeApp:linkDebugFrameworkIosSimulatorArm64  # iOS framework for Xcode
```

Run a single Kotlin test: `./gradlew :composeApp:testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.anthooop.colision.FooTest.someTest"`.

iOS app: open `iosApp/iosApp.xcodeproj` in Xcode and run. Xcode's build phase invokes Gradle to produce the `ComposeApp` static framework — Kotlin code changes require an Xcode rebuild (or the explicit `linkDebugFramework…` task above) before they're picked up.

## Flavors

Two product flavors defined in `composeApp/build.gradle.kts`:

- **development** — points at the Supabase staging project, verbose logging, debug overlays allowed, suffix `.dev` on the applicationId.
- **production** — production Supabase project, logs stripped, no debug UI.

Flavor-specific config (Supabase URL/anon key, FCM sender, feature flags) lives in `composeApp/src/{development,production}/kotlin/com/anthooop/colision/config/BuildConfig.kt` — never hardcode environment values in `commonMain`. iOS reads the same values via an `expect`/`actual` `BuildConfig` exposed through the Kotlin framework.

## Architecture

Single Gradle module `:composeApp`. Standard KMP layout under `composeApp/src/`:

- `commonMain/kotlin/com/anthooop/colision/` — shared Kotlin + Compose UI. `App.kt` is the root `@Composable`; `Platform.kt` declares the `expect` platform abstraction.
- `androidMain/` — `MainActivity.kt` hosts `App()`; Android `actual` impls + Room Android driver + Koin Android module.
- `iosMain/` — `MainViewController.kt` exposes a `ComposeUIViewController { App() }`; iOS `actual` impls + Room iOS driver + Koin iOS module.
- `commonMain/composeResources/` — Compose Multiplatform resources, accessed via `colision.composeapp.generated.resources.Res`. Add all shared assets here, not under platform-specific resource folders.

Follow **Google's Android app architecture** (UI / Domain / Data) adapted to KMP. Code is organized **by feature**, and each feature is split into **sub-screens**, not into a single screen per feature:

```

    │   │   ├── WelcomeViewModel.kt
    │   │   └── WelcomeContract.kt

    ├── agenda/                         # same structure, sub-screens TBD
    ├── meeting/
    └── arbitrage/
```

The four `screens-*.jsx` files in `docs/design/` are **categories / user journeys**, not single screens. Each one contains several sub-screens:

- **onboarding** (J1+J2 setup): welcome → projectcode → projectconfirm → identity → commission → notifications.
- **agenda** (J2 ongoing), **meeting** (J3), **arbitrage** (J4) similarly decompose into multiple sub-screens — read the relevant `screens-<category>.jsx` to enumerate them before scaffolding.

Each sub-screen gets its **own** `Route` + `Screen` + `ViewModel` + `Contract`. Do not merge several sub-screens into one ViewModel even if they share data — share via the feature `Repository` instead.

Platform-specific behavior follows the `expect`/`actual` pattern declared in `commonMain`, with implementations in `androidMain` and `iosMain`. Keep the platform surface narrow — most code lives in `commonMain`.

## Navigation — Jetpack Compose Navigation, multi-graph

Use Jetpack Compose Navigation (the KMP-compatible artifact). The root `NavHost` lives in `app/` and switches between **top-level nested graphs**, one per feature:

- `onboardingGraph` — first-run flow (welcome → projectcode → projectconfirm → identity → commission → notifications). Self-contained; on completion it pops itself and navigates to the home graph.
- `homeGraph` — main app once onboarded (`agenda`, `meeting`, `arbitrage` and their sub-screens).

Each feature declares its graph in `feature/<name>/navigation/<Name>Graph.kt` as a `NavGraphBuilder` extension:

```kotlin
fun NavGraphBuilder.onboardingGraph(navController: NavController) {
    navigation<OnboardingGraph>(startDestination = OnboardingDestination.Welcome) {
        composable<OnboardingDestination.Welcome> { WelcomeRoute(...) }
        composable<OnboardingDestination.ProjectCode> { ProjectCodeRoute(...) }
        // ...
    }
}
```

Conventions:

- Destinations are **type-safe** (`@Serializable` data objects / classes), grouped in `feature/<name>/navigation/<Name>Destination.kt`.
- The root `NavHost` decides the start graph based on auth/onboarding state read from a top-level `AppViewModel` — never branch inside a graph.
- Cross-graph navigation goes through the root `NavController` passed into each graph builder. A graph never knows about another graph's internal destinations.
- Inter sub-screen navigation **inside a graph** is exposed by the `Route` via lambdas (`onNavigateToProjectConfirm: (code: String) -> Unit`) — `Screen` composables stay navigation-agnostic.

## MVI pattern (mandatory for every sub-screen)

Each **sub-screen** has exactly four UI artifacts (not one set per feature category):

- **`*ViewModel.kt`** — holds state, coordinates use cases / repositories, exposes:
  - `val state: StateFlow<FooState>` — UI state (immutable data class, single source of truth for the screen)
  - `val events: SharedFlow<FooEvent>` — one-shot side effects (navigation, snackbars, errors)
  - `fun onIntent(intent: FooIntent)` — single entry point for user intents
- **`*Route.kt`** — stateful entry point used by the nav graph. Collects `state` via `collectAsStateWithLifecycle()`, observes `events` in a `LaunchedEffect`, forwards intents to the ViewModel. **No UI logic here** beyond plumbing.
- **`*Screen.kt`** — pure stateless Composable. Receives `state: FooState` and `onIntent: (FooIntent) -> Unit`. Material3 only. Previewable in isolation. No ViewModel, no Koin, no side effects.
- **`*Repository.kt`** — abstracts data sources (Ktor / Supabase client + Room DAO). Returns `Flow<T>` or `Result<T>`. Owns the merge strategy between remote and local.

State/intent/event types live next to the ViewModel: `FooState.kt`, `FooIntent.kt`, `FooEvent.kt` (or grouped in `FooContract.kt` if small).

Rule of thumb: if a Composable needs to call the ViewModel, it should be in the `Route`, not the `Screen`.

## Dependency injection — Koin (mandatory)

**Every** non-trivial class is injected via Koin. No manual instantiation of ViewModels, repositories, or clients in production code.

- Module wiring lives in `core/di/AppModule.kt` (top-level) and per-feature `feature/<name>/di/<Name>Module.kt`.
- ViewModels are bound via `viewModelOf(::FooViewModel)` and retrieved in the Route with `koinViewModel()`.
- Platform-specific bindings (Android `Context`, iOS `NSObject` helpers, Room driver) go in `androidMain` / `iosMain` modules registered alongside the common module.
- Koin is started in `MainActivity` (Android) and `MainViewController` (iOS) with `startKoin { modules(appModule + platformModule + featureModules) }`.

When adding a new feature, register its module in the feature module list — don't load Koin modules ad-hoc.

## Networking — Ktor

All HTTP goes through a single `HttpClient` configured in `core/network/`. Use `ContentNegotiation` + `kotlinx.serialization`, install `Logging` only on the `development` flavor, and let Koin inject the client into repositories.

For Supabase, use the `supabase-kt` client (auth, postgrest, realtime, storage) injected via Koin. Do not call Supabase REST endpoints directly with raw Ktor — always go through the supabase-kt modules so RLS and auth headers are handled.

## Local persistence — Room (KMP)

Use Room with KMP support. The database, DAOs, and entities live in `core/database/` in `commonMain`. Platform drivers (`BundledSQLiteDriver` on Android, the iOS Room driver) are provided in `androidMain` / `iosMain` Koin modules.

Room is the offline cache and source of truth for what the UI displays. Repositories expose `Flow<T>` from the DAO and refresh from Supabase in the background.

## Design contract — non-negotiable

The visual reference is in `docs/design/` (HTML/JSX prototypes — pixel-accurate spec, not to be rendered, read the source):

- `docs/design/project/tokens.jsx` — single source of truth for colors, typography (DM Sans), spacing (4-based scale), shapes. Map this into a `ColorScheme` + `Typography` in `core/design/` before implementing any screen.
- `docs/design/project/components.jsx` — shared components used across screens.
- `docs/design/project/screens-{onboarding,agenda,meeting,arbitrage}.jsx` — four screens, one per user journey.
- `docs/design/chats/chat1.md` — design intent and rationale; read before opening individual screen files.

**Before implementing any UI**: read the relevant `screens-*.jsx` and check the tokens. Every feature implementation must match the design — colors, spacing, typography, copy, layout. Theme: warm + civic, off-white `#FAF7F2`, forest green `#0E7C66` primary, coral `#C8553D` for conflicts. Light + dark modes.

Don't render the HTML in a browser — everything (dimensions, layout, copy) is spelled out in the source.

## BMAD planning artifacts

All BMAD outputs live under `docs/` (not `_bmad-output/`). PRD, product brief, and any workflow status files are kept there.
